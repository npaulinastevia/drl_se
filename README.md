# A Comparison of Reinforcement Learning Frameworks for Software Testing Tasks
This repository contains the training scripts, datasets, and experiments corresponding to our paper (link available soon)

##Requirements
Python 3.8+
## Set up
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
##Datasets.
The paper uses datasets from the papers [Reinforcement Learning for Test Case Prioritization](https://github.com/moji1/tp_rl) and 
[Wuji: Automatic Online Combat Game Testing Using Evolutionary Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/NeteaseFuxiRL/wuji).
Game_testing_problem\wuji\problem\mdp\netease\blockmaze contains the blockmaze environment and Test_case_prioritization_problem\data contains all the simple and enriched datasets discussed in the paper.
